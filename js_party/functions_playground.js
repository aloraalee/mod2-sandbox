/* To run the code in this file, run the command:
      node functions_playground.js
*/

console.log("functions_playground.js is running")


// Let's start with the examples from the lesson.  

// Lesson Example 1
// Uncomment each function call (invocation) to see what it prints to the console.

function printGreeting(greeting) {
  console.log(greeting)
}

    printGreeting('hi')  
    
    printGreeting('sup')
    
    printGreeting('oh hello there darling!')
    
// Now call the function again yourself, passing through whatever greeting you'd like.  Make sure you pass the greeting as a string (it must be in quotes).

printGreeting('oh hey hey')

// Lesson Example 2
// The function below is not printing anything to the console via console.log().  Instead, it is using the 'return' keyword to return a value each time the function is called.  
// To see the values being returned from the function invocations, we can console.log() the variables that are storing those values. 
//Uncomment the three console.log()s to see the values being stored in each variable.  These console logs have a helpful string to label each one so you can see it easier in the console.

function captureGreeting(greeting) {
  return greeting
}

var hiGreeting = captureGreeting('hi')  

var supGreeting = captureGreeting('sup')

var fancyGreeting = captureGreeting('oh hello there darling!')

console.log('hiGreeting: ', hiGreeting)
console.log('supGreeting: ', supGreeting)
console.log('fancyGreeting: ', fancyGreeting)



// Lesson Example 3
// The function below is doing the exact same thing as the one above. It is just written in the ES6 arrow function syntax.  
// Uncomment the console.log() below to see the value stored in the variable.  

var captureGreetingArrowSyntax = (greeting) => {
  return greeting
}

var helloGreeting = captureGreetingArrowSyntax('hello')  

console.log("helloGreeting: ", helloGreeting)


// NOTE FOR THE EXERCISES BELOW: "print" or "log" both mean to use a console.log()

/*  -- SECTION A: PRACTICING FUNCTIONS STRAIGHT UP -- */
//1A. Make a function called sayName that logs your first name
function sayName(name) {
  var greeting = 'Oh hey hey, '
  return greeting + name
}

var sayAlora = sayName('Alora')
console.log(sayAlora)
//2A. Edit the sayName function above to create a variable inside of the function that is equal to a greeting. Change the console log to include the greeting concatenated with your name!


//3A. Make a function called watchShow that console logs "I am watching". Then call the logFavoriteMovie function after the console log.
function watchShow() {
  console.log("I am watching");
  logFavoriteMovie();
}
console.log(watchShow)
var logFavoriteMovie = 'Good Will Hunting'

/*  --  SECTION B: FUNCTIONS WITH PARAMETERS. -- */
//1B. Create a function takes in two numbers and logs the numbers added together. Invoke the function two times with different numbers.
function sum(num1, num2) {
  console.log(num1 + num2)
}

sum(3,6)
sum(10,2)

//2B. Create a function that takes in first name and last name and logs a greeting that greets somebody by first and last name. Call the function two times with different names.

function greetName(firstName, lastName) {
  console.log('Hello ' + firstName + ' ' + lastName + '!')
}
greetName('Alora', 'Riley')
greetName('Sam', 'Wise')

// Here is an example with interpolation:
function greetName(firstName, lastName) {
  console.log(`Hello ${firstName} ${lastName}!`);
}

greetName('John', 'Doe');
greetName('Jane', 'Smith');


/*  -- SECTION C: FUNCTIONS WITH RETURNS, ARGS and PARAMS -- */
//1C. Make a function that takes in two numbers as arguments and returns the sum of those two numbers. 
// Create a variable called 'total' and assign the variable's value to be an invocation of your function (dont forget to pass in 2 numbers!)  Console log 'total'
function sumNumbers(num1, num2) {
  return num1 + num2;
}

// Let is used here instead of var because it can be reasigned
let total = sumNumbers(5, 7);
console.log(total);

//2C. Make a function that takes in the name of a board game and a person's name and returns a string of "Do you want to play (board game name) with (persons name)?". Invoke the function with two different board game titles and names.

function playBoardGame(boardGame, name) {
console.log(`Do you want to play ${boardGame} with ${name} ?`)
}
playBoardGame('Egyptian Rat Screw', 'Brian')
//  *** CANT GET ENOUGH FUNCTION PRACTICE??  HERE'S SOME MORE!

// 1D. Create a function called printInfo. This function should take in 3 arguments: `name`, `age` and `hometown`. The function should print a string that states your name, age and hometown using interpolation.


// 2D. Create a function called mathItUp. This function should take two parameters, both being numbers. The function should print the sum of the two numbers. It should also print a string that says `The value of the first parameter is ____ and value of the second parameter is _____.` The function should then return the product of these numbers + 100.
